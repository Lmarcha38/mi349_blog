    <p>I don't tend to play very many video games these days because I now spend most of my time creating video games! I've spent many years of my life now creating numerous video game projects. However, I've only released 2 of these projects to the public as games for people to play, and one of them is no longer available. Since I've been doing this for so long, I believe more and more of my projects will be released since I am past the initial learning stage. My project that I am currently working on, called SauceLore, is getting close to being ready for release. SauceLore will be available to download on Steam, and there is already a <a title="Steam Page for SauceLore" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2560730/SauceLore/">SauceLore Steam page</a> where you can wishlist the game and download a demo I made.</p>
